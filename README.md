## How does it work

Openai trained a neural network called DALL·E that creates images from text captions for a wide range of concepts expressible in natural language. Example prompt: Cat with umbrella in kimono in bamboo garden will generate am image like below:

## How It's Made:

**Back-end:** Node, Express, OpenAI API

**Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Obtain an API key from OpenAI at [Here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Make a post request to OpenAI to get image url with user input from front-end
- Fetch image url from JavaScript from front-end
- Display image

## Optimizations

OpenAI also has other fun api like Text completion and Code completion. I'd love to build more interesting projects with them in the future.

## Lesson learned

I can spend a whole day on reading about DALL·E. If you are also interested about DALL·E, check out this blog post [here](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/)
